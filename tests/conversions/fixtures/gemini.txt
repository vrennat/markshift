## Analysis Results

The data shows several interesting patterns:

1. **Growth trend** - Revenue increased by 23% year-over-year
2. **Seasonal variation** - Q4 consistently outperforms other quarters
3. **Regional differences** - APAC leads in adoption rates

### Statistical Summary

The mean value is $\mu = 42.7$ with standard deviation $\sigma = 5.3$.

```r
summary(data)
plot(data$revenue ~ data$quarter)
```

Key findings:

- Revenue is **strongly correlated** in **bold** terms with user engagement ($r = 0.89$)
- The model achieves `95.2%` accuracy on the test set
- Outliers were removed using the _IQR method_

> **Note:** These results are preliminary and should be validated with a larger dataset.

### Recommendations

| Priority | Action | Impact |
|----------|--------|--------|
| High | Increase Q4 marketing | +15% revenue |
| Medium | Expand APAC team | +8% adoption |
| Low | Optimize onboarding | +3% retention |
